1.1	L1	The	Records	of	the	Grand	Historian	,	also	known	by	its	Chinese	name	Shiji	,	is	a	monumental	history	of	ancient	China	and	the	world	finished	around	94	BC	by	the	Western	Han	Dynasty	official	Sima	Qian	after	having	been	started	by	his	father	,	Sima	Tan	,	Grand	Astrologer	to	the	imperial	court	.

1.2	L1	The	work	covers	the	world	as	it	was	then	known	to	the	Chinese	and	a	2,	500-year	period	from	the	age	of	the	legendary	Yellow	Emperor	to	the	reign	of	Emperor	Wu	of	Han	in	the	author's	own	time	.

	L6
2.2	L1	After	Confucius	and	the	First	Emperor	of	Qin	,	"	Sima	Qian	was	one	of	the	creators	of	Imperial	China	,	not	least	because	by	providing	definitive	biographies	,	he	virtually	created	the	two	earlier	figures	.	"
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
2.3	L1	The	Records	set	the	model	for	the	24	subsequent	dynastic	histories	of	China	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
2.4	L1	In	contrast	to	Western	historical	works	,	the	Records	do	not	treat	history	as	"	a	continuous	,	sweeping	narrative	"	,	but	rather	break	it	up	into	smaller	,	overlapping	units	dealing	with	famous	leaders	,	individuals	,	and	major	topics	of	significance	.
	L2
	L3

	L5
	L6
3.1	L1	The	work	that	became	Records	of	the	Grand	Historian	was	begun	by	Sima	Tan	,	who	was	Grand	Astrologer	(	Taishi	太史	)	of	the	Han	dynasty	court	during	the	late	2nd	century	BC	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
3.2	L1	Sima	Tan	drafted	plans	for	the	ambitious	work	and	left	behind	some	fragments	and	notes	that	may	have	been	incorporated	into	the	final	text	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
3.3	L1	After	his	death	in	110	BC	,	the	project	was	continued	and	completed	by	his	son	and	successor	Sima	Qian	,	who	is	generally	credited	as	the	work's	author	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
3.4	L1	The	exact	date	of	the	Records's	completion	is	unknown	,	but	it	is	certain	that	Sima	Qian	completed	it	before	his	death	about	86	BC	,	with	one	copy	residing	in	the	imperial	capital	of	Chang'an	(	present-day	Xi'an	)	and	the	other	copy	probably	being	stored	in	his	home	.	[	note	1	]

	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
4.3	L1	This	title	was	originally	used	to	refer	to	any	general	historical	text	,	although	after	the	Three	Kingdoms	period	,	[	note	2	]	Shiji	gradually	began	to	be	used	exclusively	to	refer	to	Sima	Qian's	work	.

4.4	L1	In	English	,	the	original	title	,	Records	of	the	Grand	Historian	is	in	common	use	,	although	Historical	Records	,	The	Grand	Scribe's	Records	,	and	Records	of	the	Historian	are	also	used	.

5.3	L1	32–	7	BC	)	,	added	interpolations	to	the	Records	,	and	may	have	had	to	reconstruct	portions	of	it	:	ten	of	the	original	130	chapters	were	lost	in	the	Eastern	Han	period	(	AD	25–	220	)	and	seem	to	have	been	reconstructed	later	.

6.1	L1	Beginning	in	the	Northern	and	Southern	dynasties	(	420–	589	)	and	the	Tang	dynasty	(	618–	907	)	,	a	number	of	scholars	wrote	and	edited	commentaries	to	the	Records	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
6.2	L1	Most	2nd-millennium	editions	of	the	Records	include	the	commentaries	of	Pei	Yin	(	裴駰	,	5th	century	)	,	Sima	Zhen	(	early	8th	century	)	,	and	Zhang	Shoujie	(	張守節	,	early	8th	century	)	.

6.3	L1	The	combined	commentaries	of	these	three	scholars	is	known	as	the	Sanjiazhu	(	三家注	,	"	commentaries	of	the	three	experts	"	)	.

6.4	L1	The	primary	modern	edition	of	the	Records	is	the	ten-volume	Zhonghua	Book	Company	edition	of	1959	(	revised	in	1982	)	,	and	is	based	on	an	edition	prepared	by	the	Chinese	historian	Gu	Jiegang	in	the	early	1930s	and	includes	the	Sanjiazhu	.

8.2	L1	Portions	of	at	least	nine	Tang	dynasty	manuscripts	survive	:	three	fragments	discovered	among	the	Dunhuang	manuscripts	in	the	early	20th	century	,	and	six	manuscripts	preserved	in	Japanese	temples	and	museums	,	such	as	the	Kōzan-ji	temple	in	Kyoto	and	the	Tōyō	Bunko	museum	in	Tokyo	.

	L6
9.1	L1	In	all	,	the	Records	is	about	526,	500	Chinese	characters	long	,	making	it	four	times	longer	than	Thucydides'	History	of	the	Peloponnesian	War	and	longer	than	the	Old	Testament	.

10.1	L1	Sima	Qian	conceived	and	composed	his	work	in	self-contained	units	,	with	a	good	deal	of	repetition	between	them	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
10.2	L1	His	manuscript	was	written	on	bamboo	slips	with	about	24	to	36	characters	each	,	and	assembled	into	bundles	of	around	30	slips	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
10.3	L1	Even	after	the	manuscript	was	allowed	to	circulate	or	be	copied	,	the	work	would	have	circulated	as	bundles	of	bamboo	slips	or	small	groups	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
10.4	L1	Endymion	Wilkinson	calculates	that	there	were	probably	between	466	and	700	bundles	,	whose	total	weight	would	have	been	88–	132	pounds	(	40–	60	kg	)	,	which	would	have	been	difficult	to	access	and	hard	to	transport	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
10.5	L1	Later	copies	on	silk	would	have	been	much	lighter	,	but	also	expensive	and	rare	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
10.6	L1	Until	the	work	was	transferred	to	paper	many	centuries	later	,	circulation	would	have	been	difficult	and	piecemeal	,	which	accounts	for	many	of	the	errors	and	variations	in	the	text	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
11.1	L1	Sima	Qian	organized	the	chapters	of	Records	of	the	Grand	Historian	into	five	categories	,	which	each	comprise	a	section	of	the	book	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
12.1	L1	Basic	Annals
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
13.1	L1	The	"	Basic	Annals	"	(	běnjì	本紀	)	make	up	the	first	12	chapters	of	the	Records	,	and	are	largely	similar	to	records	from	the	ancient	Chinese	court	chronicle	tradition	,	such	as	the	Spring	and	Autumn	Annals	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
13.2	L1	The	first	five	cover	either	periods	,	such	as	the	Five	Emperors	,	or	individual	dynasties	,	such	as	the	Xia	,	Shang	,	and	Zhou	dynasties	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
13.3	L1	The	last	seven	cover	individual	rulers	,	starting	with	the	First	Emperor	of	Qin	and	progressing	through	the	first	emperors	of	the	Han	dynasty	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
13.4	L1	In	this	section	,	Sima	chose	to	also	include	de	facto	rulers	of	China	,	such	as	Xiang	Yu	and	Empress	Dowager	Lü	,	while	excluding	rulers	who	never	held	any	real	power	,	such	as	Emperor	Yi	of	Chu	and	Emperor	Hui	of	Han	.

14.1	L1	Tables
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
15.1	L1	Chapters	13	to	22	are	the	"	Tables	"	(	biǎo	表	)	,	which	are	one	genealogical	table	and	nine	other	chronological	tables	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
15.2	L1	They	show	reigns	,	important	events	,	and	royal	lineages	in	table	form	,	which	Sima	Qian	stated	that	he	did	because	"	the	chronologies	are	difficult	to	follow	when	different	genealogical	lines	exist	at	the	same	time	.	"
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
15.3	L1	Each	table	except	the	last	one	begins	with	an	introduction	to	the	period	it	covers	.

16.1	L1	Treatises
	L2

	L4
	L5
	L6
17.1	L1	The	"	Treatises	"	(	shū	書	,	sometimes	called	"	Monographs	"	)	is	the	shortest	of	the	five	Records	sections	,	and	contains	eight	chapters	(	23–	30	)	on	the	historical	evolution	of	ritual	,	music	,	pitch	pipes	,	the	calendar	,	astronomy	,	sacrifices	,	rivers	and	waterways	,	and	financial	administration	.

	L4
	L5
	L6
19.1	L1	The	"	Hereditary	Houses	"	(	shìjiā	世家	)	is	the	second	largest	of	the	five	Records	sections	,	and	comprises	chapters	31	to	60	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
19.2	L1	Within	this	section	,	the	earlier	chapters	are	very	different	in	nature	than	the	later	chapters	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
19.3	L1	Many	of	the	earlier	chapters	are	chronicle-like	accounts	of	the	leading	states	of	the	Zhou	dynasty	,	such	as	the	states	of	Qin	and	Lu	,	and	two	of	the	chapters	go	back	as	far	as	the	Shang	dynasty	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
19.4	L1	The	later	chapters	,	which	cover	the	Han	dynasty	,	contain	biographies	.

	L6
20.1	L1	Ranked	Biographies
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
21.1	L1	The	"	Ranked	Biographies	"	(	lièzhuàn	列傳	,	usually	shortened	to	"	Biographies	"	)	is	the	largest	of	the	five	Records	sections	,	covering	chapters	61	to	130	,	and	accounts	for	42	%	of	the	entire	work	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
21.2	L1	The	69	"	Biographies	"	chapters	mostly	contain	biographical	profiles	of	about	130	outstanding	ancient	Chinese	men	,	ranging	from	the	moral	paragon	Boyi	from	the	end	of	the	Shang	dynasty	to	some	of	Sima	Qian's	near	contemporaries	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
21.3	L1	About	40	of	the	chapters	are	dedicated	to	one	particular	man	,	but	some	are	about	two	related	figures	,	while	others	cover	small	groups	of	figures	who	shared	certain	roles	,	such	as	assassins	,	caring	officials	,	or	Confucian	scholars	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
21.4	L1	Unlike	most	modern	biographies	,	the	accounts	in	the	"	Biographies	"	give	profiles	using	anecdotes	to	depict	morals	and	character	,	with	"	unforgettably	lively	impressions	of	people	of	many	different	kinds	and	of	the	age	in	which	they	lived	.	"
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
21.5	L1	The	"	Biographies	"	have	been	popular	throughout	Chinese	history	,	and	have	provided	a	large	number	of	set	phrases	still	used	in	modern	Chinese	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
22.1	L1	Unlike	subsequent	official	historical	texts	that	adopted	Confucian	doctrine	,	proclaimed	the	divine	rights	of	the	emperors	,	and	degraded	any	failed	claimant	to	the	throne	,	Sima	Qian's	more	liberal	and	objective	prose	has	been	renowned	and	followed	by	poets	and	novelists	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
22.2	L1	Most	volumes	of	Liezhuan	are	vivid	descriptions	of	events	and	persons	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
22.3	L1	Sima	Qian	sought	out	stories	from	those	who	might	have	closer	knowledge	of	certain	historical	events	,	using	them	as	sources	to	balance	the	reliability	and	accuracy	of	historical	records	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
22.4	L1	For	instance	,	the	material	on	Jing	Ke's	attempt	at	assassinating	the	King	of	Qin	incorporates	an	eye-witness	account	by	Xia	Wuju	(	夏無且	)	,	a	physician	to	the	king	of	Qin	who	happened	to	be	attending	the	diplomatic	ceremony	for	Jing	Ke	,	and	this	account	was	passed	on	to	Sima	Qian	by	those	who	knew	Xia	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
23.1	L1	It	has	been	observed	that	the	diplomatic	Sima	Qian	has	a	way	of	accentuating	the	positive	in	his	treatment	of	rulers	in	the	Basic	Annals	,	but	slipping	negative	information	into	other	chapters	,	and	so	his	work	must	be	read	as	a	whole	to	obtain	full	information	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
23.2	L1	For	example	,	the	information	that	Liu	Bang	(	later	Emperor	Gaozu	of	Han	)	,	in	a	desperate	attempt	to	escape	in	a	chase	from	Xiang	Yu's	men	,	pushed	his	own	children	off	his	carriage	to	lighten	it	,	was	not	given	in	the	emperor's	biography	,	but	in	the	biography	of	Xiang	Yu	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
23.3	L1	He	is	also	careful	to	balance	the	negative	with	the	positive	,	for	example	,	in	the	biography	of	Empress	Dowager	Lu	which	contains	startling	accounts	of	her	cruelty	,	he	pointed	out	at	the	end	that	,	despite	whatever	her	personal	life	may	have	been	,	her	rule	brought	peace	and	prosperity	to	the	country	.

25.2	L1	Sima	Qian's	father	Sima	Tan	served	as	Grand	Historian	,	and	Sima	Qian	succeeded	to	his	position	.
	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5

	L2
	L3
	L4
	L5
	L6
25.4	L1	Sima	Qian	was	a	methodical	,	skeptical	historian	who	had	access	to	ancient	books	,	written	on	bamboo	and	wooden	slips	,	from	before	the	time	of	the	Han	dynasty	.
	L2
	L3

25.6	L1	He	not	only	used	archives	and	imperial	records	,	but	also	interviewed	people	and	traveled	around	China	to	verify	information	.
	L2

27.1	L1	I	myself	have	travelled	west	as	far	as	K'ung-t'ung	,	north	past	Cho-lu	,	east	to	the	sea	,	and	in	the	south	I	have	sailed	the	Yellow	and	Huai	Rivers	.
	L2

	L4
	L5
	L6
27.2	L1	The	elders	and	old	men	of	these	various	lands	frequently	pointed	out	to	me	the	places	where	the	Yellow	Emperor	,	Yao	,	and	Shun	had	lived	,	and	in	these	places	the	manners	and	customs	seemed	quite	different	.

29.1	L1	The	Grand	Historian	used	The	Annals	of	the	Five	Emperors	(	五帝系諜	)	and	the	Classic	of	History	as	source	materials	to	make	genealogies	from	the	time	of	the	Yellow	Emperor	until	that	of	the	Gonghe	regency	(	841–	828	BC	)	.
